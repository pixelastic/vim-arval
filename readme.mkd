What is it ?
============

Splitest is a very simple plugin that should allow you to run tests from your
files in a very easy way.

Simply press `F5` when editing a test file and you'll see the
test results displayed in a split window. Press `F5` again, `q` or `Ctrl+D` and the
split window will close.

Languages
=========

So far Splitest only works for Ruby files, but I might extend it later for
other languages.
