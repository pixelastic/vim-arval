The features of Splitest used to live in my vimrc file, but I decided to pack
it as a plugin to make it easier to install and try.

This is a very simple plugin that will run tests of the current file and
display them in a split windows when pressing F5. This will of course also work
when editing the test file itself.

Currently Splitest only works for ruby, and your test files need to be in
a `./tests` subdirectories and named `*.test.rb`.
